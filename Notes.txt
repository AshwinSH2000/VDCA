VDCA Implementation Notes

1. Median pivot for quicksort
To find the pivot, i decided to go with the median of elements.
But that means sorting the array and then finding the middle.
This defeats the purposr because my usecase was to sort it. 
So I found three methods: 1. Sort and middle as usual 2. Median of median-didnt like it 3. Median of three (pick first, mid and last and find its median) 
The 3rd option seems to be the ideal for me.  

2. In CH, i have removed the stroke and fill arguments while creating the <g>
Instead it has to be added manually each time. Hence if some lines or partitions are not getting printed/rendered, it is because of a missing css style entry. 

Experienced this..today! The final greenline for collinear terminal hull wasnt getting printed. Just added a CSS style and its fine now. I had removed stroke and fill argument to solve a problem and I dont seem to remember what it was!

Got it. it is to add the dull lines when the partitionlines and its partitions are not in focus. Having a fixed stroke and fill always had the same intensity always. By moving the property to a css styling, I can render bright lines when that partition is in focus and render dull lines when it goes out of focus. 

3. One div can only be appendChild() to one other div. 
If you need to add it to different divs, you need to clone it. REMEMBERRRRRR
