VDCA Implementation Notes

1. Median pivot for quicksort
To find the pivot, i decided to go with the median of elements.
But that means sorting the array and then finding the middle.
This defeats the purposr because my usecase was to sort it. 
So I found three methods: 1. Sort and middle as usual 2. Median of median-didnt like it 3. Median of three (pick first, mid and last and find its median) 
The 3rd option seems to be the ideal for me.  

2. In CH, i have removed the stroke and fill arguments while creating the <g>
Instead it has to be added manually each time. Hence if some lines or partitions are not getting printed/rendered, it is because of a missing css style entry.
