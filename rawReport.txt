1. Quicksort

How is it implemented?
i. Accepting input
ii. Repeated clicking on divide and conquer along with/or once click on solve until final result is achieved. 

The user is given the liberty to input the numbers. They can input as many numbers as needed and click 'Insert' button or press 'Enter/Return'. The numbers can either be either comma separated or space separated. On entering the numbers, grey rectangular bars are displayed on the screen whose height is equal to the value of the numbers. Once the user has entered all the numbers, they have two options - 'Divide' or 'Solve'. Clicking on 'Solve' will instantly display the final sorted array. However, if the user clicks on 'Divide', then the algorithm initially picks a pivot element using the 'Median of 3' approach. In this approach, the first, middle and the last element are placed in the sorted order and the median element is chosen. This becomes the pivot element to sort the array. The numbers of the arrays are then rearranged in such a way that all the numbers that are smaller than the pivot are placed on the left side of pivot and all numbers larger than the pivot are placed on the right side of pivot. After this, another set of bars are drawn based on the new arrangement of numbers but the pivot element is shaded with a different colour and placed with a slighly larger gap from all other elements. The colour of the pivot elements are based on the level of partition (level 0 - red, level 1 - blue, level 2 - green, level 3 - orange, level 4 - brown, level 5 - violet, level 6 - greenyellow). Level simply means how deep the partitions are made. For example, when the user clicks 'Divide' for the first time, it is called level 0, next click of 'Divide' is called level 1 and so on. Once a new set of bars are displayed below the original input bars, one can clearly see there are two groups of numbers separated by the pivot element. When the user clicks on 'Divide' again (level 1), each of these partitions is treated as a whole array and the same process is repeated, where a pivot is chosen, the numbers are rearranged, and new row of rectangular bars are drawn with all the pivots highlighted. Level 1 can have a maximum of 4 partitions. Whenever the user clicks 'Divide', the array is further partitioned until either all the elements are chosen as pivot elements or there is just one element in each new partition. At this time,
